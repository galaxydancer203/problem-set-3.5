<p><h3 style= "text-align:left"> So, rock climbing is just trying to get to the top of the wall any way you can. If you decide on a rock wall
  with a difficulty and the difficulty has an assigned color tape to it, your hands and feet can only land on rocks that is taped with that colored tape (Example: A 5.8 difficulty rock wall has rocks marked with blue tape).

<p> <h3> Here are some tips to help you rock climb better:
</p></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Push up from your legs instead of pulling up with your arms</li>
  <li>Keep your arms extended</li>
  <li>Set your feet before moving your hands. Get good, solid footholds that you can put weight on</li>
  <li>Plan your moves in advance, putting your limbs in position for each move</li>
  <li>Find good resting points to plan your route and relax your arms</li>
</ul>
