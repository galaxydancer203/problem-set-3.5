 <p> <h4>After you colect all your equipment you need to rock climb, you need to put on your harness. Harnesses are not always the same so these instructions might not work to put your harness. You should ask your partner or intructor to help you:
   <ol>
     <li>Loosen the buckles: Start with the waistbelt and leg-loop buckles.</li>
      <li>Remove twists: Straighten out the waistbelt or leg loops.</li>
       <li>Step into the harness: Step through the waistbelt and into the leg loops, and then pull the harness up.</li>
        <li>Tighten the buckles: Snug up the waistbelt and leg-loop buckles.</li>
         <li>Make sure the loose ends of the straps/buckles are not loose or swinging. </li>
          <li><b>Double-check everything. </b></li>

    </ol>

   <p>After you put on your harness, you need to tie yourself to the rock climbing wall using the figure-eight knot. Since this is your first time rock climbing, you should ask your partner or intructor to tie it for you. Click <a href="https://youtu.be/GFlwrvggas0" target="_blank">here</a> to go to a Youtube video that shows you step by step on how to tie yourself into the rock wall using the figure-eight knot. This is because I think I won't do a good job of explaining it here.
     <ul>
       <li> Note: You should pick and tie yourself to a 5.5 to a 5.8 wall. It is for beginner rock climbers since it is easy. It should be marked by colored tape but ask your partner or intructor to find a easy rock wall.
    </ul>
<p>To start properly on the wall, you and your partner must say these following commands in this order:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>First, double check that both you and your partner/intructor are correctly strapped into the rock wall. Get approval from your more experienced partner or intructor.
    <li>Climber (You): “On belay?” (Meaning: Are you ready to belay me?)</li>
    <li>Belayer (Partner): “Belay on.” (Meaning: Slack is gone and I’m ready.)</li>
    <li>Climber (You): “Climbing.” (Meaning: I’m going to climb now.)</li>
      <li>Belayer (Partner): “Climb on.”(Meaning: I’m ready for you to climb.)</li> <h4>
  </ol>
